As you know, there are many scientific programming languages in the world. In this post, we will talk a little about the most famous and used languages in various fields of science.

One important language is Bash, an updated Unix shell first released in the late 80s. Server configuration scripts are usually written in Bash. Applications: server administration, CLI tools, DevOps, virtualization.

COBOL belongs to one of the oldest but still used languages. It was created by Grace Hopper in the late 1950s and was intended to standardize the development of large-scale business applications on computers. An incredible 95% of ATM transactions go through COBOL systems, with many of these devices operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Applications: banking/finance, international corporations, governments.

The most powerful and fastest languages are C/C++. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed by Bjorn Stroustrup in 1985. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that value low-level hardware access and performance. Applications: OS/SDK development, embedded devices, game engines, science.

Dart is a fairly modern programming language developed by Google for creating mobile, desktop, web and server applications. Dart provides a rich set of features suitable for defining complex interactions, asynchronous operations, animations, and more. Applications: cross-platform applications, cloud services/corporate systems, games, graphics.

Fortran was created in the 1950s by John Backus to carry out scientific and engineering work. Applications: aerospace/defense, scientific computing, numerical analysis.

JavaScript was developed by Brandon Eich in the 90s to add scripting to websites. Today it is a universal web interface language with powerful, standardized features that are supported by all major browsers. Applications: full-stack development, cloud services/container storage, games, utilities.

It is impossible not to mention Python - one of the most famous languages, not even in the circle of programmers. This language is well established and will remain one of the most requested tools for a long time to come. Applications: artificial intelligence/machine learning, data mining, cloud services/web, media, scripts.

The last language I would like to touch on is SQL. This language belongs to the universal programming languages and is a powerful domain-specific language for managing relational databases. Advanced skills allow the developer to create extremely secure and robust domain rules that are independent of the programming language or SDK used. High profile implementations include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. Each of them has a unique extension of the SQL language and offers new features that go beyond the core SQL specification. Applications: working with relational data, embedding data in applications.
