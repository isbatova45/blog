Markdown is a markup language used to create rich text using a text editor. It can be opened and modified in any text editor. Widely used for writing documentation and README files.

Markdown was created by writer and blogger John Gruber along with web activist Aaron Schwartz. They wanted to come up with the simplest and most convenient markup language with which text can be translated into a beautifully designed look. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without being reduced to a “beautiful” look. This is what Markdown turned out to be. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the most popularity now. It is supported by a variety of blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS, and even instant messengers.

Markdown contains basic elements that can be found in almost any README.md:
- first level heading for the title;
- highlighting in bold type important parts in the description;
- link with clear text;
- second-level heading for sub-items;
- a bulleted list to list the benefits.

In general, Markdown is used for quickly formatting an article for translation into PDF, layout of a text document for placement on the site, but without the use of HTML, writing documentation for the code, making notes in a personal digital notebook.
