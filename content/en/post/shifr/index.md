Encryption is the transformation of information in order to hide it from unauthorized persons. It is with the help of encryption that three states of information security are provided: confidentiality, integrity and identifiability. In any encryption algorithm, the key is important - it approves the choice of a particular transformation. An encryption key is a set of numbers and letters used by an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt information. The strength of the key depends on its length in bits.

Encryption can be symmetrical or asymmetric. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. And with asymmetric encryption (encryption with a public key), the encryption and decryption keys are different, which makes this option more reliable.
