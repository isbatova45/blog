I use the Markdown markup language to design the report. At the beginning of the file, the number of the laboratory work on which the report is being made, the discipline and the full name of the student who completed the work is always indicated. The purpose of the work is indicated below, then each stage of working with screenshots is described step by step, a link is indicated for each screenshot. At the end of the work there is a conclusion consistent with the topic of the work, as well as answers to control questions.

The "#" sign is used to create headers. In addition, you can format the text - to set the bold style, you need to put double asterisks on both sides of the text, for italic style - single. To create unordered lists, asterisks or dashes are used (it is possible to nest one list in another), to quote the symbol >.

To generate a file from md to pdf and docs format, I use Pandoc.
